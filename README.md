### Automatic Atomic Swaps

Clove is a library that makes atomic swaps between chains easy. Any bitcoin-based and Ethereum-based chains, including ERC20 tokens, support atomic swaps.

Here's a list of the chains we are working on.

Bitcoin Based:
* Bitcoin
* Bitcoin Gold
* Bitcoin Cash
* Litecoin
* Dash
* Zcash
* Hshare
* Monacoin
* Dogecoin
* Decred

Ethereum Based:
* Ethereum
* Ethereum Classic
* ERC20 Tokens
* Other Smart Contract Standards

Other / Researching:
* Monero
* EOS
* NEO
* Lisk
* Ark

Will this work with the Pact smart contracting language? Yes. The end goal is to integrate this automatically into Cilantro as the interoperability protocol so that all of these chains can communicate with Lamden projects and vice versa.
